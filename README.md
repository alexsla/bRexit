# bRexit

This repository contains source code, documentation, and R data for the "bRexit" package.
This package contains a single function. If you choose to run it, it will generate an infinite loop.
There is no end product. It just runs indefinitely, slowing your system down until the inevitable heat death of the universe, or until you system crashes - whichever occurs first.
The good news is this will only happen if you choose to use bRexit.

To install, write the following line in your R console:

devtools::install_github("alexsla/bRexit")

Use at your own discretion. But honestly, why would you?
